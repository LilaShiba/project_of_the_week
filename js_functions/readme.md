### Code Together

Goal: Create a function that returns how long a user has been alive for.


**Define the function**
```js
function checkAge(birthYear) {
  // local scope
  let age = 2020 - birthYear
  // data outputted by function
  return age
}

```

**Call the function**
```js
// how to run the function
checkAge(1988)
// save output of function to variable
let userAge = checkAge(2001)
```

## Student Lab
We want to return how long a person has been alive for. Now, try to calculate with precision the following:

- How many months
- How many weeks
- How many days ( don't forget leap years!)
- Try using a date library if you are super far ahead

**Plan ahead**
- What parameters do you need to add to the checkAge function?
- What user errors can we expect?
- Programming is a naming problem. Be mindful how you name functions, parameters, and variables.
